[Idafat: The Arab Journal of
Sociology](https://caus.org.lb/product-category/%D9%85%D8%AC%D9%84%D8%A9-%D8%A5%D8%B6%D8%A7%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%AA/)
has just published an [Arabic
translation](https://edoc.unibas.ch/61091/) (open access) of my
article, ['Autonomy and Symbolic Capital in an Academic Social
Movement: The March 9 Group in
Egypt'](https://doi.org/10.4000/ejts.4780). I'm glad that I was able
to make this research accessible to more readers, especially readers
in Egypt who have been directly affected by the events discussed in
the article. The effort that I put into getting it published in Arabic
will be rewarded if it contributes something to discussions about
social movements in Egypt before and since the revolutionary uprising
of 2011.

This is the only one of my publications that has been through peer
review twice: once for the original publication in [European Journal
of Turkish Studies](https://journals.openedition.org/ejts/), and a
second time for _Idafat_. [Mounir
Saidani](http://tunis.academia.edu/MounirSaidani), professor of
sociology at the [University of Tunis El
Manar](http://www.utm.rnu.tn/utm/fr/), translated it well, and I
revised the translation somewhat.

For a brief summary of the article and its context, see [The Making of
'Autonomy and Symbolic Capital in an Academic Social Movement']({{<
