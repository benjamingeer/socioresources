The _European Journal of Turkish Studies (EJTS)_ has just published my
article ['Autonomy and Symbolic Capital in an Academic Social
Movement: The March 9 Group in
Egypt'](https://doi.org/10.4000/ejts.4780) (open access), as part of a
special issue on demobilization at universities in Turkey and in other
countries.

### What It's About

The March 9 Group for University Autonomy is a small group of Egyptian
university professors who have campaigned, since 2003, against the
regime's interference in academic affairs and campus life. The article
suggests that the group’s survival for such a long time under Mubarak,
and its limited successes, depended on the involvement of renowned
academics, on participatory democracy, and on the avoidance of
conflicts between professors. I suggest that all these assets became
liabilities following the revolutionary uprising of January 2011, and
that this is why the group has largely demobilized.

### Why I Did It

In August 2012, when I was a post-doc at the National University of
Singapore, I started to plan a long-term research project on the
autonomy of Arab academics and on their ability to reach
non-specialist audiences as intellectuals or activists. I wanted this
project to include something on the March 9 Group. Jordi Tejel, the
editor of this issue of _EJTS_, then invited me to contribute an
article to the issue. In order to meet the publication deadlines, I
suggested a small-scale study focusing on March 9. This would allow me
to start working on the issues I was interested in, while producing an
article in the time available.

### What I Like About It

Social movement theory hasn't paid much attention to activists'
prestige, but during my own experience as an activist (in London, long
ago), it seemed to me that social movements were keen to
involve prestigious activists. So I'm glad I finally had a chance to
do a study that deals with this aspect of activists' careers. I'm also
glad to have written about events that I see as historically important
and that might otherwise have been forgotten. And since my PhD was
about intellectual projects that I see as basically misguided, it was
a pleasant change to study a group whose work I respect.

### What I Wish I Could Have Done

Some of the activists I interviewed belong to families that have
produced generations of well-known activists, and I wish I had had the
time and space to explore that phenomenon further. I also would have
liked to include the perspectives of Muslim Brotherhood members who
were involved in these events, as well as the views of non-activist
academics.

### What Next?

Since I had to do this study in a limited amount of time, I did it
using methods I was very familiar with. I think the need to publish
quickly tends to limit the autonomy of research, because it
discourages the researcher from taking the time to learn new
techniques, and favours the reproduction of well-known, low-risk
methods. Next I'd like to a research project involving techniques,
especially quantitative ones, that I'm less familiar with.
