Here's a video of a 40-minute introductory talk I gave on the
Qur&#8217;an and the early history of Islam, on 30 January 2013 at the
National University of Singapore. The talk was part of a lecture
series called 'Introduction to the Study of the Contemporary Middle
East', organised by the university's [Middle East
Institute](http://www.mei.nus.edu.sg), where I was then a post-doc.

I didn't try to do anything more than summarise the current state of
scholarship on the topic, including the main areas of disagreement
among specialists. The video was then
[posted](http://iqsaweb.wordpress.com/2013/09/09/geer/) on the blog of
the International Qur&#8217;anic Studies Association, which [some of
the big names in the
field](http://iqsaweb.wordpress.com/membership/people/) are involved
in.

You'll notice that there's hardly anything sociological in this talk,
beyond some attempts to describe, in broad terms, the sort of social
environment that Islam emerged in. I think this reflects the
preoccupations of mainstream research on early Islam. Sociology seems
mostly absent from these preoccupations, and I can think of several
possible reasons for this. First of all, the formidable empirical
difficulties faced by specialists may have largely eclipsed
theoretical concerns. This comment from the introduction to a recent
edited volume on Qur&#8217;anic studies gives some idea of these
difficulties:

> The academic discipline of Qur&#8217;anic studies today is most
> strikingly characterized, not by any impressive scholarly achievements
> of the field itself, which has been appropriately diagnosed by Fred
> Donner as being 'in a state of disarray', but by the
> large-scale interest of the media that the Qur&#8217;an's origin
> and interpretation have solicited during the last decade or
> so. Indeed, the lacunae of the field&mdash;impossible to overlook when
> confronted with the impressive list of what has been achieved in
> biblical or classical studies&mdash;have developed into a veritable
> litany: There is no critical edition of the text, no free access to
> all of the relevant manuscript evidence, no clear conception of the
> cultural and linguistic profile of the milieu in which it has emerged,
> no consensus on basic issues of methodology, and&mdash;what is perhaps
> the single most important obstacle to future scholarly
> progress&mdash;no adequate training of future students of the
> Qur&#8217;an in the non-Arabic languages and literatures and cultural
> traditions that have undoubtedly shaped its historical context.[^1]

Another possible reason is the uneasy relationship between the
disciplines of history and sociology in general. As Robert Harrison
observes:

> Of history's cognate disciplines, sociology has always seemed
> the closest, but at the same time the most intrusive, the most
> hectoring, the most contemptuous of historical
> practice... Sociology has always claimed a position among the
> social sciences, a status which most historians have been decidedly
> reluctant to assume.

And yet, as he notes, 'Weber and the other founders of the discipline
were essentially historical sociologists.'[^2]

Mainstream sociology has been slow to take an interest in Islam. In
1974, sociologist Brian Turner lamented:

> An examination of any sociology of religion textbook published in the
> last fifty years will show the recurrent and depressing fact that
> sociologists are either not interested in Islam or have nothing to
> contribute to Islamic scholarship.[^3]

The editor of a recent handbook of sociology of religion put it this way:

> A generation ago, mainstream sociology of religion concerned itself
> almost exclusively with Western society, leaving the rest of the
> world to anthropology, and within that framework with
> Christianity.[^4]

The situation has improved somewhat in recent years, but sociological
studies of religion are still mainly focused on Christianity:

> Smilde and May (2010:14) report that between 1978 and 2007 just over
> 50 percent of the articles about religion published in sociology of
> religion journals dealt with Christianity. Poulson and Campbell
> (2010:38) also found that 82 percent of the articles published between
> 2001 and 2008 in the _Journal for the Scientific Study of
> Religion_ and _Sociology of Religion_ dealt with Christian
> communities (see also Beyer 2000).[^5]

Some prominent figures in sociology, starting with Max Weber, have
proposed sociological interpretations of aspects of the history of
Islam, with mixed results. In a detailed critical study entitled
_Weber and Islam_, first published in 1974, Bryan Turner credited
Weber with a valid interpretation of patrimonial state bureaucracy in
Islamic empires, but found that Weber's attempt to understand
early Islam was marred by the misconceptions and false assumptions of
the the Orientalist scholarship he relied on.[^6] In a recent article
looking back on that study, Turner wrote:

> There has unsurprisingly been in the intervening three and a half
> decades a steady stream of commentary on both Weber's sociology of
> religion and his observations on Islam, but despite the sustained
> criticism his sociological approach has not been radically surpassed
> in comparative sociological studies of religion... Weber's vision
> of 'Asian religions' has been condemned as an example of Orientalism
> in which a dynamic West is contrasted with and counter-posed to a
> stagnant East... Despite these criticisms, Weber's approach remains
> valid as a general framework, partly because, while Said's account
> of Orientalism provided some valuable criticisms, it did not

I agree that sociology shouldn't be content to critique discourses,
and should offer systematic explanations of social reality. However, I
think Pierre Bourdieu's account of religion improves considerably on
Weber's.[^8] Turner noted, in his earlier study, that 'Weber's
position with regard to the relationship between beliefs and social
structures is often inconsistent or at best obtuse', and argued that
'because of the problems of consistency within Weber's sociology, no
definitive or authoritative interpretation of Weber is genuinely
possible'.[^9] Bourdieu's concept of 'field' first emerged from his
attempt to recast Weber's sociology of religion as a systematic
theoretical framework, focusing on the interests at stake in the
production and consumption of religious 'goods'. The notion of
religious fields makes it possible to understand how the social
structures involved in religion relate to those in other spheres of
human activity. And the concept of 'habitus', which outlines a general
solution to the problem of the relationship between beliefs and social
structures, enabled Bourdieu to solve some of the problems in Weber's
notion of the 'charisma' of religious leaders.[^10]

However, the more sociology explains religion in terms of interests,
the less religious believers are likely to be comfortable with it. A
recent sociology of religion textbook observes:

> Sociology and its relativizing perspectives can become an existential
> threat to the religious believer... In all human sciences, there are
> differences and tensions between what social actors think and believe
> and the scientific interpretations of these thoughts and beliefs. Yet
> the tension is intensified when the scholars claim that a phenomenon
> is a social product and the social actors believe that it is a message
> from God.[^11]

A recent study suggests that the field of the sociology of religion is
dominated by religious believers:

> The labels used in the study of religion reflect a 'hegemonic'
> position within the discipline that religion should be normative and
> that actions that threaten religious fidelity are deviant... In this
> article, we argue at length why we think this bias exists, suggesting
> it is likely due to the historical connections to religions
> (especially Roman Catholicism) of the three main professional
> organizations dedicated to studying religion and the religiosity of
> the members of those organizations... In short, those with power and
> resources, both institutions and the majority of scholars in this
> area, have used that power to portray non-religion as a deviant
> status.[^12]

Sociologists who are also religious believers have an interest in not
exploring hypotheses that would contradict their own faith. Moreover,
my impression&mdash;as an outsider to the field of sociology of
religion&mdash;is that there is a tacit agreement among mainstream
specialists that even when they are writing about religions to which
they do not belong, they should avoid challenging the core doctrines
accepted by believers. It may be that the social structure of the
field makes it advantageous to have good relations with peers of other
faiths, and hence favours an ecumenical outlook. The extreme version
of this commitment is found in arguments for purely phenomenological
approaches to religion, like that of Wilfred Cantwell Smith, who
claimed:

> No statement of Islamic faith is true that Muslims cannot accept. No
> personalist statement about Hindu religious life is legitimate in
> which Hindus cannot recognise themselves. No interpretation of
> Buddhist doctrine is valid unless Buddhists can respond: 'Yes! That
> is what we hold'.[^13]

A tacit understanding that 'I won't try to undermine your faith if you
don't try to undermine mine' could account for Eric J. Sharpe's
observation that

> several contemporary Western scholars of religion harbor an implicit
> commitment to religious diversity and openness... They are
> critical towards the dogmatic dimensions of their childhood religious
> traditions, but at the same time, they reveal openness and curiosity
> regarding alternative religiosity and other religious traditions.[^14]

This could be one reason why, although sociological research on Islam
is now more common than it once was, it seems to be interested mainly
in the present day. Sociological interpretations of early Islamic
history would be more likely to involve issues that are central to
Muslims' faith. For example, the papers collected in a recent edited
volume entitled _The Sociology of Islam_ are all focused on the
present or on recent history, and none attempts to explain the early
history of Islam as Weber did.[^15]

The reluctance of non-Muslim sociologists to approach such issues may
also reflect current political struggles in the United
States. Overall, the sociology of religion is highly US-centric:

> In their recent review of 30 years of sociological scholarship on
> religion, Smilde and May (2010) found that over 70 percent of all
> journal articles focused on religious dynamics in the United
> States. Similarly, Poulson and Campbell (2010), reviewing articles
> published in the _Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion_ and
> _Sociology of Religion_ between 2001 and 2008, reported that less
> than 20 percent showcased research on a non-Western geographic
> region.[^16]

I wouldn't be surprised to find that the academic stances of American
sociologists of religion tend to reflect their political stances
regarding US domestic and foreign policy. Social scientists' political
views tend to lean towards the left.[^17] Right-wing discourse in the
US demonises Muslims, portrays Islam as America's national enemy, and
advocates the invasion of Muslim-majority states. My sense is that
there's a widespread feeling among scholars&mdash;both Muslim and
non-Muslim&mdash;that it's urgent to focus on doing research that
challenges this discourse, and I can't blame them for that. By
revealing social realities that political discourse obscures or
misrepresents, sociology can promote mutual understanding and
coexistence among people with different beliefs. On the other hand,
perhaps some scholars are also concerned that any contradiction
between sociological hypotheses and Muslim doctrine risks being
perceived as supporting hostility towards Muslims. I think that there
are ways to ask inconvenient questions while ensuring that one's
intentions are not misunderstood, and that the autonomy of social
science is not served if such questions are avoided.
