Edward Said’s _Orientalism_ pointed out the folly of assuming
'that the swarming, unpredictable, and problematic mess in which
human beings live can be understood on the basis of what
books—texts—say,' but the field of Islamic Studies doesn't
seem to have paid much attention. Job descriptions emphasise knowledge
of canonical texts, and published work, such as Shahab Ahmed's
_What Is Islam?_ (2016), is often written as if you could understand,
say, Sufism just by reading classical Sufi philosophy, without taking
a close look at what Sufis actually do.

While I was reading Bourdieu's _Pascalian Meditations_, it
occurred to me that Islamic Studies is afflicted with what Bourdieu
called the scholastic fallacy: the belief that you can explain the
actions of people in non-scholarly situations by projecting scholarly
thinking onto them. This isn't a matter of distinguishing
between 'elite' and 'popular' practices. In
everyday life, everyone, including off-duty scholars, relies on what
Bourdieu called practical sense, which 'makes it possible to
appreciate the meaning of the situation instantly, at a glance, in the
heat of the action, and to produce at once the opportune
response.'

If you want to understand people's practical sense, you really
need to spend time with them, listen to them, and notice what they
do. It would also help to get to know their cultural references,
e.g. by watching the films they watch. Naturally, if you don't
speak their language, you have to learn it. In the 2000s, I was lucky
enough to be able to do this in Egypt, which was then one of the best
places to learn spoken Arabic. Since then, Egypt has become a more
dangerous place for foreign students and researchers. Even getting
access to archives can be difficult. What happens to research when
students can't learn the necessary languages, do fieldwork, or
access archives? They might be tempted to use canonical texts as a
substitute. But if you try to make those texts answer questions about
everyday life, you fall into the scholastic fallacy.

I wrote about these problems, and about possible solutions, in
'Training Scholars to Study Non-Scholarly Life', a chapter in
[Teaching Islamic Studies in the Age of ISIS, Islamophobia, and the
Internet](https://iupress.org/9780253039804/teaching-islamic-studies-in-the-age-of-isis-islamophobia-and-the-internet/),
edited by Courtney M. Dorroll. The pre-print of the chapter is freely
available [here](https://edoc.unibas.ch/69151/).
