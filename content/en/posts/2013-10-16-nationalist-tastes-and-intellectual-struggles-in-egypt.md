This is a talk I gave at the annual meeting of the Middle East Studies
Association in New Orleans on 12 October 2013, in the panel 'The
Politics of Taste in the Late Ottoman Empire and Egypt'. In under 15
minutes, it outlines the main argument of my [PhD
thesis](https://eprints.soas.ac.uk/13185/) and gives a few examples.

Here's the abstract:

In the early 20th century, Egyptian effendi intellectuals used
nationalism to introduce new tastes in literature, cinema, music,
journalism, and other cultural practices into Egypt. To this end, they
constructed a nationalism that portrayed them as ideally qualified to
be the nation’s guides, in contrast to the clergy, whose
qualifications they devalued. Thus the promotion of nationalist tastes
not only advanced effendi intellectuals’ careers by creating demand
for their products; it was also a strategy in a broader struggle among
Egyptians over prestige, credibility, and economic interests. This
struggle was carried out in the pages of novels and essays, in
political conflicts over educational policy, in courtrooms, and in the
streets. The nationalism that emerged from this struggle, and became
part of respectable mainstream tastes, increasingly resembled
religion, and helped legitimize military dictatorship in the 1950s.
