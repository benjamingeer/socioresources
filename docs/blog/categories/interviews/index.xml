      <description>Mona Abaza interviews me on openDemocracy:
There&amp;rsquo;s a school of thought that says it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter whether nations are real, because people behave as if they are. But false beliefs can have very destructive effects: think of witch trials, or the denial of climate science. Belief in nations is dangerous because, since they&amp;rsquo;re imaginary, you can say whatever you want about them and no one can prove you wrong&amp;hellip;
Strangely, although nationalism is a pervasive social phenomenon with immense effects everywhere in the world, it’s not a central preoccupation of sociology or any of the dominant social science disciplines.</description>
