      <description>Edward Said’s Orientalism pointed out the folly of assuming &amp;lsquo;that the swarming, unpredictable, and problematic mess in which human beings live can be understood on the basis of what books—texts—say,&amp;rsquo; but the field of Islamic Studies doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to have paid much attention. Job descriptions emphasise knowledge of canonical texts, and published work, such as Shahab Ahmed&amp;rsquo;s What Is Islam? (2016), is often written as if you could understand, say, Sufism just by reading classical Sufi philosophy, without taking a close look at what Sufis actually do.</description>

      <description>Ten Arab Filmmakers: Political Dissent and Social Critique is an edited volume about the films and careers of Arab directors whose films take a critical view of social realities. It includes a chapter by me (open access) on how the Egyptian filmmaker Yousry Nasrallah has succeeded in occupying a rather autonomous position in the cinematographic field.</description>

      <description>Idafat: The Arab Journal of Sociology has just published an Arabic translation (open access) of my article, &amp;lsquo;Autonomy and Symbolic Capital in an Academic Social Movement: The March 9 Group in Egypt&amp;rsquo; . I&amp;rsquo;m glad that I was able to make this research accessible to more readers, especially readers in Egypt who have been directly affected by the events discussed in the article. The effort that I put into getting it published in Arabic will be rewarded if it contributes something to discussions about social movements in Egypt before and since the revolutionary uprising of 2011.</description>

      <description>The European Journal of Turkish Studies (EJTS) has just published my article &amp;lsquo;Autonomy and Symbolic Capital in an Academic Social Movement: The March 9 Group in Egypt&amp;rsquo; (open access), as part of a special issue on demobilization at universities in Turkey and in other countries.
What It&amp;rsquo;s About The March 9 Group for University Autonomy is a small group of Egyptian university professors who have campaigned, since 2003, against the regime&amp;rsquo;s interference in academic affairs and campus life.</description>

      <description>This is a talk I gave at the annual meeting of the Middle East Studies Association in New Orleans on 12 October 2013, in the panel &amp;lsquo;The Politics of Taste in the Late Ottoman Empire and Egypt&amp;rsquo;. In under 15 minutes, it outlines the main argument of my PhD thesis and gives a few examples.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the abstract:
In the early 20th century, Egyptian effendi intellectuals used nationalism to introduce new tastes in literature, cinema, music, journalism, and other cultural practices into Egypt.</description>
