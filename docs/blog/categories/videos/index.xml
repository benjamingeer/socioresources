In under 15 minutes, it outlines the main argument of my PhD thesis and gives a few examples.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the abstract:
In the early 20th century, Egyptian effendi intellectuals used nationalism to introduce new tastes in literature, cinema, music, journalism, and other cultural practices into Egypt.</description>
