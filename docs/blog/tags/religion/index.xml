      <description>Edward Said’s Orientalism pointed out the folly of assuming &amp;lsquo;that the swarming, unpredictable, and problematic mess in which human beings live can be understood on the basis of what books—texts—say,&amp;rsquo; but the field of Islamic Studies doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to have paid much attention. Job descriptions emphasise knowledge of canonical texts, and published work, such as Shahab Ahmed&amp;rsquo;s What Is Islam? (2016), is often written as if you could understand, say, Sufism just by reading classical Sufi philosophy, without taking a close look at what Sufis actually do.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a video of a 40-minute introductory talk I gave on the Qur’an and the early history of Islam, on 30 January 2013 at the National University of Singapore. The talk was part of a lecture series called &amp;lsquo;Introduction to the Study of the Contemporary Middle East&amp;rsquo;, organised by the university&amp;rsquo;s Middle East Institute, where I was then a post-doc.
   I didn&amp;rsquo;t try to do anything more than summarise the current state of scholarship on the topic, including the main areas of disagreement among specialists.</description>
