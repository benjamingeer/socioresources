      <description>Edward Said’s Orientalism pointed out the folly of assuming &amp;lsquo;that the swarming, unpredictable, and problematic mess in which human beings live can be understood on the basis of what books—texts—say,&amp;rsquo; but the field of Islamic Studies doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to have paid much attention. Job descriptions emphasise knowledge of canonical texts, and published work, such as Shahab Ahmed&amp;rsquo;s What Is Islam? (2016), is often written as if you could understand, say, Sufism just by reading classical Sufi philosophy, without taking a close look at what Sufis actually do.</description>

      <description>Ten Arab Filmmakers: Political Dissent and Social Critique is an edited volume about the films and careers of Arab directors whose films take a critical view of social realities. It includes a chapter by me (open access) on how the Egyptian filmmaker Yousry Nasrallah has succeeded in occupying a rather autonomous position in the cinematographic field.</description>
